    "## Using Deep Learning Approaces to Detect Arthritis in Radiographs\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will explore the application of CNN and RNN approaches as potential diagnostic tools for arthritis, using a dataset of human knee (patellar joint) radiographs. My hope is to expand it to veterinary applications as more patellar radiographs from different species comes available. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project can be found at this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/knee-osteoarthritis-dataset-with-severity/data\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this project, I chose to download the data directly to my machine. I've prevented it from uploading to git using .gitignore. If you would like to replicate this code, you'll need to download the data files from the abovementioned link. \n",
    "\n",
    "This arthritis detection project includes the following three deliverables:\n",
    "1. This notebook\n",
    "2. A video presentation (powerpoint slides will be available on Git)\n",
    "3. a public GitHub repository, found here: https://github.com/Kate-Zilla/deep-learning-arthritis-detection \n",

    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "The goal of this project is to determine the applicability of deep learning approaches when it comes to arthritis detection and diagnosis. \n"
